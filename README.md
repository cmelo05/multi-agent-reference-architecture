# Multi-Agent Reference Architecture

This repository showcases a conceptual guide with practical references to architecting a multi-agent system, preparing you to _design for change_: balancing long-term extensibility with pragmatic, shipping-first engineering.

The content is grounded by learnings from real-world, production-scale implementations built with Microsoft customers, offering an opinionated yet agnostic thinking that applies across enterprises, technology stacks and frameworks.

> [!NOTE]  
> Generative AI is advancing rapidly, with new models, patterns, protocols and paradigms constantly emerging. While the current design is intentionally agnostic and broad, we expect to refine and improve it as the ecosystem matures.

The target audience are software architects and engineers with high level understanding of Generative AI and [agentic services](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents).
