# Event-Driven Communication in Multi-Agent Systems

In an event-driven model, agents interact by producing and consuming events,
rather than issuing explicit requests and waiting for responses.

In this paradigm, the orchestrator and specialized agents respond to the
occurrence of events (such as new tasks, status updates, or errors) that are
published to a shared bus or message broker. This approach supports loosely
coupled, scalable, and resilient agent workflowsâ€”particularly suited for
long-running, distributed, or highly dynamic multi-agent systems.
